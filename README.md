# Advent of Code  
Solutions to challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) done in Rust.  
All solutions are written by [@dashaw92](https://github.com/dashaw92) in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/)  

# Goals  
The main goal of doing these problems for me is to practice my Rust skills obviously. However  
another side goal is that all solutions use as little 3rd party code as possible. I prefer  
implementing the solutions myself whenever possible. There are exceptions to this of course,  
where I feel that the external dependency I include doesn't take away from solving the puzzle.  
For example, implementing md5, unless the problem specifically implements this hashing method,  
isn't particularly interesting in terms of solving these puzzles, so using the `md5` crate would  
be fine. On the other hand, including `itertools` for the permutations implementation would be  
cheating, because if I'm using that method on iters, the problem almost certainly pertains to  
implementing that myself. :)

# Note  
As per Eric Wastl's wishes, input files are not tracked (there are some exceptions where I wrote the
solution prior to finding this wish.)  

# AoC
Thank you Eric!
